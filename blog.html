                            (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, author, investor, and
                            philanthropist.
                            He is a co-founder of <b>Microsoft</b>, along with his late childhood friend Paul Allen.
                            During
                            his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer

                            president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder
                            until May 2014. He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and
                            1980s.

                            Gates was born and raised in Seattle. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in
                            <b>Albuquerque</b>,
                            New Mexico. It became <b>the world's largest personal computer software company</b>. Gates
                            led
                            the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by
                            Steve
                            Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software
                            architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which have
                            been
                            considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June
                            2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill &
                            Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife Melinda
                            established in 2000. <b>He stepped down as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February

                            and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed <i> CEO Satya
                                Nadella</i>. In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire
                            Hathaway
                            to focus on his philanthropic efforts on climate change, global health and development, and

                        <p>Bill Gates was born in Seattle,<b> Washington </b>on October 28, 1955. He is the son of
                            William
                            H.
                            <b> Gates Sr.[b] (1925–2020)</b> and <b> Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994)</b>. His ancestry
                            includes
                            English,
                            German, and Irish/Scots-Irish. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served
                            on
                            the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of <i> America.
                                Gates's</i>
                            maternal grandfather was <i> J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president </i>. Gates has an
                            older sister
                            <b> Kristi </b> (Kristianne) and a younger sister <b> Libby</b> . He is the fourth of his
                            name in his family
                            but
                            is known as William Gates III or "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father had the "II"
                            suffix. The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was
                            damaged by
                            a rare tornado when Gates was <i> seven years old</i>.
                        </p>

                        <p class="p">
                            Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.
                            When he was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational <b>
                                Christian
                                Churches</b>, a Protestant Reformed denomination. Gates was small for his age and
                            was bullied as a child. The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it
                            didn't matter whether it was <i> hearts </i> or <i> pickleball </i> or <i> swimming </i> to
                            the dock; there was always
                            a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".
                        </p>

                        <p class="p">
                            At 13, he enrolled in the private
                        <p> Lakeside prep school</p>, where he <i> wrote his first
                            software program </i>. When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used
                        proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a
                        block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students. Gates took
                        an interest in programming <b> the GE system in BASIC </b> , and he was excused from math
                        classes to
                        pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program this machine, an implementation
                        of <b> tic-tac-toe </b>that allowed users <i> to play games against the computer </i> <b> Gates
                            was fascinated </b>
                        by the machine and <b> how it would always execute software code perfectly </b>. After the
                        Mothers Club donation was exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems
                        including <i> DEC PDP minicomputers </i>. One of these systems was a <s>PDP-10 </s> <i>
                            belonging to <u> Computer
                                Center Corporation </u> <b> (CCC) </b> which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and
                            Gates's best
                            friend and first business partner </i> <b> Kent Evans </b>, for the summer after it caught
                        them exploiting
                        bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time
                        </p>

                        <p class="p">
                            The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money. At the end of the
                            ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather
                            than using the system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and <b> studied
                                source
                                code </b> for <i> various programs that ran on the system </i>, including <u> Fortran
                            </u>, <u> Lisp</u>, and <u> machine
                                language</u>. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970 when the company went out of
                            went out of
                            business......

                        <p class="p">
                            The following year, a Lakeside teacher enlisted Gates and Evans to automate the school's
                            class-scheduling system, providing them computer time and royalties in return. The duo
                            worked diligently in order to have the program ready for their senior year. Towards the end
                            of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident, which Gates has
                            described as one of the saddest days of his life. Gates then turned have the to Allen who
                            helped him
                            finish the system for Lakeside.

                            At <b> 17 </b>, Gates formed a venture with Allen called <u> Traf-O-Data </u> to make
                            traffic counters based
                            on the <b> Intel 8008 processor </b>.In <b> 1972 </b>, he served as a congressional page in
                            the House of
                            Representatives. He was a National Merit Scholar when he graduated from Lakeside
                            School in <i> 1973 </i>. He scored <b> 1590 </b> <i> out </i> of <b> 1600 </b> on the <u>
                                Scholastic Aptitude Tests </u> <b> (SAT) </b> and
                            <i> enrolled </i> at <b> Harvard College in the autumn of 1973 </b>. He chose a pre-law
                            major but took
                            mathematics (including Math 55) and graduate level computer science courses. While at
                            Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while
                            Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. <i> Years later </i>, <i> Ballmer succeeded

                    Gates read the <i> January 1975 </i> issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the <b> Altair
                        8800 </b> , and he
                    contacted <u> <b> Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems</b> </u> <b> <i> (MITS) </i> </b> to
                    inform them that he and others were
                    working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform. In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an
                    Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. <b> MITS
                        president
                        Ed Roberts </b> agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they
                    developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The
                    demonstration was held at MITS's offices in <b> Albuquerque </b> , <i> New Mexico </i>; it was a
                    success and resulted
                    in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen, and Gates
                    took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in <i> November 1975 </i>. Allen named
                    their
                    partnership <i><b><u> "Micro-Soft"</u></b></i>, a combination of <i><b><u> "microcomputer"
                            </u></b></i> and <i><b><u> "software" </u></b></i>, and their first office
                    was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric
                    Weiland. They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name
                    <i><b><u> "Microsoft" </u></b></i> with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on <b><i> November
                            26, 1976.</i></b> Gates never

                <p class="p"> <b> Microsoft's Altair BASIC</b> was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered
                    that a
                    pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. In <b> February 1976
                    </b>, he

                    BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair <b><i><u> "hobby market" </u></i></b> was in

                    software. This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his
                    belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became <i> independent

                <p class="p">
                    <b> IBM </b>, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time,
                    approached
                    Microsoft in <b> July 1980 </b> </b> concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, <b><i>
                            the IBM PC</i></b>, after
                    <i> Bill Gates's mother </i>,<b> Mary Maxwell Gates </b>, mentioned Microsoft to <b> John Opel </b>,
                    <i>IBM's CEO </i> . IBM first
                    proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they
                    needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to <b><i><u> Digital Research </u></i></b> <b>
                        (DRI) </b>, makers of the widely
                    used CP/M operating system. IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and
                    they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing
                    difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an
                    operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using <b><i> 86-DOS </i></b>, an
                    operating system
                    similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of <i><b><u> Seattle Computer Products </u></b></i> <b> (SCP)</b>
                    had made for hardware similar
                    to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and
                    later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC and
                    <i> delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of <b><u> $50,000 </u></b>. </i>

                </p>

                <p class="p">
                    The contract itself only earned Microsoft a relatively small fee. It was the prestige brought to
                    Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system that would be the origin of Microsoft's
                    transformation from a small business to the leading software company in the world. Gates had not
                    offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other
                    personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware. <i> They did, making the IBM-compatible PC
                    </i>,
                    running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of MS-DOS <i> (the version of DOS sold to customers
                        other
                        than IBM) </i> made Microsoft a major player in the industry. The press quickly identified
                    Microsoft
                    as being very influential on the IBM PC. PC Magazine asked if Gates was " <i><b><u> the man behind
                                the

                    Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on <b> June 25, 1981 </b>, which re-incorporated the
                    company
                    in <b> Washington state </b> and <i> made Gates the president and chairman of the board </i>, with
                    Paul Allen as vice

                    lymphoma diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen,
                    which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.
                    Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated

                    1989. Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1985 when Gates announced Microsoft Excel: "Bill Gates likes the

                    in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks
                    <b> 50 years </b> into the future, Gates stated: <b><i> "there'll be some really bad things that'll
                            happen in the
                            next 50 or 100 years </i></b>, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million
                    people that you
                    didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation
                    as the <b><i><u> "real driver of progress" </u></i></b> and pronounced that <i><b><u> "America's way
                                better today than it's ever
                                been."</u></b></i>

                <p class="p p-1">
                    Gates has expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence; <b> in a Reddit "ask me
                        anything </b>", he stated that:
                </p>
                <p class="p p-2">
                    First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be
                    positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to
                    be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people
                    are not concerned.

                    In an interview that was held at the TED conference in <b> March 2015 </b>, with <b><i> Baidu's CEO,
                            Robin Li,</i></b> Gates
                    said he would <b> "highly recommend"</b> Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths,
                    Dangers,
                    Strategies. During the conference, Gates warned that the world was not prepared for the next
                    pandemic, a situation that would come to pass in <b> late 2019 </b> when the <i> COVID-19 pandemic
                        began </i> . In
                    March 2018, Gates met at his home in Seattle with Mohammed bin Salman, the reformist crown prince
                    and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia to discuss investment opportunities for Saudi Vision
                    2030.In June 2019, Gates admitted that losing the mobile operating system race to Android
                    was his biggest mistake. He stated that it was within their skill set of being the dominant player,
                    but partially blames the antitrust litigation during the time. That same year, Gates became an
                    advisory board member of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.

                <p class="p p-3">
                    On March 13, 2020, Microsoft announced Gates would be leaving his board positions at Berkshire
                    Hathaway and Microsoft to dedicate his efforts in philanthropic endeavors such as climate change,
                    global health and development, and education.

                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates has widely been looked at by media outlets as an expert on the
                    issue, despite him not being a public official or having any prior medical training.[91] His
                    foundation did, however, establish the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator in 2020 to hasten the
                    development and evaluation of new and repurposed drugs and biologics to treat patients for
                    COVID-19,[92] and, as of February 2021, Gates expressed that he and Anthony Fauci frequently talk
                    and collaborate on matters including vaccines and other medical innovations to fight the
                    pandemic.
